1 - optimize execution order such that intermediate result is smaller
stmt s1, s2; while w; variable v;
Select <s1, s2> such that Next*(s1, s2) and Affects(s1, s2) and Parent(w, s1) pattern w (v, _) with v.varName = "tempF"
31 33, 31 15, 30 34, 31 31, 30 30, 30 16
2000
2 - return early since Modifies(a, "tempG") is not satisfied
stmt s1, s2; while w; assign a; if i1, i2;
Select BOOLEAN such that Next*(s1, s2) and Affects(s1, s2) and Parent(w, s1)  and Modifies(a, "tempG")
FALSE
